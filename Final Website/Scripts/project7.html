            <div class="text-game">We were tasked to create a game. It was my first time creating a game, and it was a very confusing and long process for me, but I am happy with the final results. It is a story narrative driven game, where the meaning and lesson behind it was based on my own personal childhood experience, making the game all that more important to me, but at the same time, I feel it's a story lots of people can relate to.</div>
