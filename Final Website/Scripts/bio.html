            <p>A Little Bit About Me: I grew up in Oklahoma to a Chinese immigrant family. As you can imagine, this cultural background shapes much of my identity, personal life, and work. Those skills and ideas have translated over in mainly traditional forms of art, which I have more of a background in. I practiced a lot of colored pencils, watercolor, Chinese painting, and other forms of 2D mediums. Starting anew in university and majoring in Design and Tech at Parsons, I thought I would try my hand in more digital mediums and tech to reshape what my art can be as well as elevating my previous skills. Below is just more facts about me.</p>
            <p>Some of my personal interests outside of just art are reading, baking, and history. As previously, mentioned, I am not very skilled with tech yet, but am hoping that I can improve during my time at Parsons part of the New School. After earning my bachelor's degree, I am hoping to find a career in either UI/UX designing, marketing, we design, or any general graphic design job. </p>
